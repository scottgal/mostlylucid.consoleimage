00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
- Do you know what time it is?

4
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
- Do you know what it is?

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
- It's unbelievable, isn't it?

6
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's half wooden in the morning.

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Someone can do something.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
- Perfect, I can't.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
- Pack it in.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
- Go, please.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000

(door closes)

30
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
(audience laughs)

32
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Sorry.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(audience laughs)

39
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
- Oh, nasty.

40
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You must have had a reaction to the white portfolio.

41
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
- You do understand why I have to, though.

42
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
- Yeah, because Frankenstein is the doctor.

43
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
- He is the doctor.

44
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
- Yeah.

45
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
- The monster is the monster, but Dr. Frankenstein is the man who created it.

46
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
- Everything has to be right with you, hasn't it?

47
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
- What are you chatting about?

48
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Something fun?

49
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
- Oh!

50
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(audience laughs)

51
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
- Can I be part of this fudg chat?

52
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
- All right, calm down.

53
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I didn't know it was ready.

54
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
- I mean, shut up, I can't hear you over the fryer.

55
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
- Yes, because you're having a chatty party with Mr. Winkey.

56
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
(audience laughs)

57
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
(audience laughs)

58
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
- Perhaps you could get a little bell?

59
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(audience laughs)

60
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
- What did you say?

61
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
- Just...

62
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
- Perhaps you could get a little bell.

63
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(audience laughs)

64
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
- A little bell.

65
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
- Yes.

66
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That is what you are saying to me.

67
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
(audience laughs)

68
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
- That is your suggestion.

69
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
A little bell.

70
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(audience laughs)

71
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
- Yes.

72
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
- I'm sorry.

73
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
(audience laughs)

74
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
- Don't be a fantastic idea.

75
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
(audience laughs)

76
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It is.

77
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's fantastic.

78
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
- Oh.

79
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Actually, also.

80
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
- No more tips on how to run my business.

81
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
(audience laughs)

82
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
- Right.

83
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You got lucky with a little bell, of course.

84
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
(audience laughs)

85
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
- What is wrong with your face?

86
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Are you doing a pirate?

87
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
- He had a run name with Frankenstein.

88
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
- Frankenstein, is that the pirate?

89
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
(audience laughs)

90
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
- Michael!

91
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
(door slams)

92
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
(audience laughs)

93
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
- Why didn't he you?

94
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
- No.

95
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
- I did allergic reaction to windscreen wiper fluid.

96
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
- What you drinking that for?

97
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
(audience laughs)

98
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
- Are you drowning your sorrows?

99
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
- No.

100
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
- No.

101
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
- It's a slippery slope, that Michael,

102
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
won't you start with us?

103
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
- Oh, there you are, snarched.

104
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
- What happened?

105
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
- It's been drinking wiper fluid.

106
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
(audience laughs)

107
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
- That's just slippery slope, moment four.

108
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
(audience laughs)

109
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
- So what I have you sold in, he will listen.

110
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
- I have not a wiper fluid alcoholic.

111
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
- Well, let's just admit you have a problem.

112
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I don't have a problem.

113
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
- He's doing a pirate.

114
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
- I am not doing a pirate.

115
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
- The great pirate Frankenstein.

116
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
(audience laughs)

117
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
- Frankenstein wasn't a pirate.

118
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It was a big monster with a boat and his neck.

119
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
- No, he was a doctor.

120
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
(audience laughs)

121
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
- Oh, what?

122
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Wouldn't want him telling me I was pregnant.

123
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
(audience laughs)

124
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
- You two have some funny ideas, Michael.

125
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
(audience laughs)

126
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
- Morning, morning.

127
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
- Morning.

128
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
- What do you think you do in?

129
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
- See, then, I give them permission.

130
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
- Why?

131
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
- Publicity, it can't hurt.

132
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
- Exactly, the sort of small local business that my party

133
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is supporting.

134
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Mr. bullet, bullet, hello.

135
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
- Hello.

136
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
- Has built a thriving business.

137
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
This is the message we're trying to get across.

138
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We can do anything.

139
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
(audience laughs)

140
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
- I'll have the full English, please.

141
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
- Or should I say the full Turkish?

142
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
(audience laughs)

143
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
- What, then, a muting statement?

144
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
(audience laughs)

145
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
- Hey, are you?

146
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I've got a bonj of pick with you.

147
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
- Oh, yes.

148
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
- When are you going to do something about that noise at night?

149
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Bloody road works, keeping me awake till all hours?

150
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
- Well, if there's a problem, let's work together

151
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to sort it out.

152
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We can do anything.

153
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
- Well, do you assume it about it?

154
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
- If I get one, I'm terrible trouble getting back to sleep again.

155
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And if I do way of nightmares, I had one last night.

156
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I was up at three, and a witch was climbing up after me.

157
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Oh, it was horrible.

158
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In the end, I have to kick her in the face.

159
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
(audience laughs)

160
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But it didn't matter.

161
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
She used to come in and come in.

162
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(audience laughs)

163
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Thank goodness.

164
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I turned into a bird and flew away.

165
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
(audience laughs)

166
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
(audience laughs)

167
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
(audience laughs)

168
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
- What are you going to do about that one?

169
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
(audience laughs)

170
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
- Well, I'm not sure there's much I can do in this particular case.

171
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
- Oh, for ever to say why not?

172
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(audience laughs)

173
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Because I can't control dreams.

174
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
- Is it your body first though?

175
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Clearly it's the thing we can do anything.

176
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
(audience laughs)

177
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
- Yes, but it's, shouldn't it surely say we can do certain things?

178
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
(audience laughs)

179
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
- No, it's, can you do anything?

180
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
- Well, well, I think I do anything.

181
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
- Can you do anything?

182
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
(audience laughs)

183
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
- I'm getting you the word I think.

184
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
- Can you do anything?

185
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
- It's hardly reason.

186
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
- Can you do anything else on the question?

187
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(audience laughs)

188
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
- I think we need to move on.

189
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Thank you very much.

190
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
- Yes.

191
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
- Thank you.

192
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
- For your questions.

193
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
(audience laughs)

194
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
- Well, you and Charlie Martha,

195
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
they're what to say, didn't he?

196
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
- He's only running 'cause he wants to be an MP one day.

197
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
He doesn't have any interest in this area.

198
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
- Yeah, politics.

199
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It's all nonsense, isn't it?

200
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
- Oh, that's not a good answer.

201
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Do you ever imagine if everyone felt like that?

202
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
- Everyone does feel like that.

203
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
- You really were against us, no where.

204
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Politics is too important to be left to politicians, Arthur.

205
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
- No, you have to get involved.

206
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
People power.

207
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
- What are you talking about?

208
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
- I'm talking about our civic duty.

209
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Our duty to stand up and be counted.

210
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
- So what you're saying is you think Arthur

211
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
should run for local elections.

212
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
- Oh, dear Lord, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

213
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
- It's very kind of a Michael, but that's simply not possible.

214
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
- I'm not suggesting it.

215
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
- It's no good leave-in politics to the politicians, Arthur.

216
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
- Nope, they're the ones who know what they're doing.

217
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
- I must say, I do find your proposal tempting, though, Michael.

218
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
- No proposal, proper posing, really,

219
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
really don't think you should do it.

220
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
- No, but I've just got far too much on at the moment.

221
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
- Thank God.

222
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
- I appreciate that, Michael.

223
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Nice to know you have faith in me.

224
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
- I'm not going to do it.

225
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
(audience laughing)

226
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
- Oh, God, well, no, no, cry it out loud.

227
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
(grunting)

228
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
- Will you shut up?

229
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I tell you you can push someone just so far.

230
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
- I'll do again.

231
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
- I don't really know you, not.

232
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I've got to stop to this.

233
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
In fact, I would like to take this occasion

234
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
to officially announce my running for election.

235
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Now I will see what's what.

236
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(audience laughing)

237
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:23.000
- Well done, Nikki.

238
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They'll have to take us seriously, now.

239
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Right then, that's the sign, just don't.

240
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Now we'll have a think tank to form the policies

241
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
for our manifesto.

242
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I want this to be an open forum,

243
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
so come on, people.

244
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Ideas, you're always much a part of this as I am.

245
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
- Well, I would get the ball rolling.

246
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
National hat allowance.

247
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
- What's that?

248
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
- Just that everybody gets a small payment

249
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
towards their hat budget.

250
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
- Where we going ever?

251
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
- Yeah, budget.

252
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
- Stop thinking about yourself, John.

253
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
- We're all in it together.

254
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(audience laughing)

255
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
- That's a coach.

256
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Three glasses.

257
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
The expensive ones that do, that the won't let you touch.

258
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Three expensive glasses.

259
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
- For everybody, Arthur?

260
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
- No, just me, I mean, yes.

261
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
(audience laughing)

262
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Michael, I owe you a great desk of thanks.

263
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
May the country owe you a great desk of thanks?

264
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
- No, you've done this was not my idea.

265
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Whatever is about to happen is not my fault.

266
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
- If it's a fact, there won't be can happen.

267
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I used to box in the army, you know.

268
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
- I didn't know that, Arthur.

269
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
- Oh, yes, I can.

270
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I had good early for him, but no stamina.

271
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So if I didn't win the fight immediately,

272
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I was as good as dead.

273
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
(audience laughing)

274
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It's their self-same qualities.

275
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I want to bring to this fight.

276
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
(audience laughing)

277
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
These signs are all spelled wrong.

278
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
They're all spelled wrong.

279
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Every single one of them, hands of our pensions.

280
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
(audience laughing)

281
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
You do realize that means less than nothing.

282
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
That means that pensions have hands.

283
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
That's spotted, Michael.

284
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
You can be head of communications.

285
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
- No, I cannot, but I won't just do this one sign.

286
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
You cannot go out with this sign looking like that.

287
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
- He's like the signs, mom.

288
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Michael, is head of communications.

289
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
- Oh, I am not.

290
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
- Oh, be there head of communications.

291
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
- What?

292
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
- You're joking.

293
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You imagine what Arthur would be like with any power.

294
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
- Well, he's not likely to win, is he?

295
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
- But anybody else got any ideas.

296
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Come on, people.

297
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
- This is supposed to be a fish tank.

298
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
(audience laughing)

299
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
- We need to ban eggs.

300
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
- Oh, well, yes, Eggie.

301
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
- Yes, Eggie, but we have to tread carefully there.

302
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
That is a much more controversial issue

303
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
than me getting a new hat and glasses.

304
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
(audience laughing)

305
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
We don't want to scare off the voting floater.

306
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
(audience laughing)

307
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But listen, we need something else,

308
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
something that will really woo the electricians.

309
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
(audience laughing)

310
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The electorate.

311
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
- Yes, exactly.

312
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Something to woo the expexor.

313
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
(audience laughing)

314
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
A phrase that would have really stick in people's minds

315
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
like we're on to you.

316
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
(audience laughing)

317
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
That sounds threatening.

318
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
- Do you like this?

319
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
- Yes.

320
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
- What you need to focus on is something they don't do

321
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
at listening.

322
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
That's the problem with politicians.

323
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
They don't listen.

324
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So how about we're listening?

325
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Brilliant, that's it.

326
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
We're listening.

327
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Good idea, Michael.

328
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
- Oh, well, that's why I'm your head of communications.

329
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
- Right, now let's talk about me getting a new patio.

330
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
(audience laughing)

331
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
- Well, what we really need around here is a lot more.

332
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
- Excuse me.

333
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I actually hadn't finished.

334
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Let me get a word in.

335
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I mean, that is why our message to you is we're listening.

336
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I'm with that in mind.

337
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Could I count on your support for the upcoming thing that's coming up?

338
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's not a difficult word.

339
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It's just jumped up my head.

340
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
You know, everyone, you know,

341
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
you put your mark on a piece of paper.

342
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Oh, you know, then they count them.

343
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And one person becomes a kind of king.

344
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Oh, tell you what to do.

345
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
What is the word?

346
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
- I'm sorry.

347
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I don't know.

348
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
- Oh, you'd know.

349
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
- Eggy.

350
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
What's the word for the thing I'm doing?

351
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
- Can we sing?

352
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
- No, the thing it's all for.

353
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
- I think it's all for.

354
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
- Yes.

355
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
- Oh, come on, you know.

356
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
- The thing that happens at the end.

357
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
- At the end.

358
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
- At the end.

359
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
- Yes.

360
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
- Elections.

361
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
- Elections.

362
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
- Elections.

363
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
(audience laughing)

364
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
- So, can we count on your support?

365
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
- Yeah.

366
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
(audience laughing)

367
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
- No, you'll be speak.

368
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
(audience laughing)

369
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
- Never in the field.

370
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
- I'm a human convict.

371
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
- I believe this passionately.

372
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Have I stood before you?

373
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
- Well, a clear mandate.

374
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
- I don't think I said to you in blackpool.

375
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
- We are all in this together.

376
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
- And there are some tough choices to be made.

377
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
(audience laughing)

378
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
- But you know, she really was the papers princess.

379
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
(audience laughing)

380
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
- And if elected, I promise, I would represent you fully

381
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
in getting all this noise stopped from the roadworks

382
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
that wake him up all night long.

383
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
(audience laughing)

384
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
- Yes.

385
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
It's my solemn pledge to you.

386
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
- Security, security, in Britain's future.

387
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
(audience laughing)

388
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
- Time to roll up our sleeves.

389
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
You don't need an apostrophe on a plural.

390
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
(audience laughing)

391
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
- This is our fight, don't you kidding me?

392
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
(audience laughing)

393
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
- More important on that.

394
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I want you to get the way here.

395
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We're not going anywhere.

396
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And we're listening.

397
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I'm sorry, I'm not answering any questions.

398
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I've got to go somewhere.

399
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
(audience laughing)

400
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
- Whoa, honey, I'm sure you have all agreed.

401
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
- So, why you had a security?

402
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Why, what are your credentials?

403
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
- Marker Dainchos.

404
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
20 years ago, our form partners are currently

405
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
taking the princess Michael of Kenya.

406
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
(audience laughing)

407
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
- One day she was shopping in Harrods,

408
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and a man approached her.

409
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
He reached for his jacket pocket, and...

410
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
- I'm waiting here.

411
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
- I'll still pull the shine today.

412
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I ran away.

413
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
(audience laughing)

414
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You ran away.

415
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
- Yeah, I'll panic.

416
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
- Where did he go?

417
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
- I'll hit him in Donald's.

418
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
(audience laughing)

419
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
- Right.

420
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
They're not really credentials.

421
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
(audience laughing)

422
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
- I don't understand what you mean.

423
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
- Just...

424
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We're listening to us.

425
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
- See you.

426
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
- But I'm not saying anything.

427
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
- Well, you ought to say something,

428
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
because if you do, I'd be here listening to it.

429
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
- Or what kind of thing?

430
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
- Well, I don't know.

431
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Something about crime.

432
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
- What about crime?

433
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
- What are you asking, Mayful?

434
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
- I'm the one that's listening.

435
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
- Of your setup.

436
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
(audience laughing)

437
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
- Actually, can I use you to join us?

438
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
(audience laughing)

439
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
(gunshot)

440
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
- Put the owners on, decided.

441
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
- Right, come on, let's go to the next one.

442
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
- We should go round Arthur.

443
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
- We'll go in this way.

444
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
- Who'd a bush?

445
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
- We should just go round.

446
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
- Not going all the way down there.

447
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
- Then all the way back up here.

448
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
- Just go straight.

449
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
- How can't guarantee you're shiny

450
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
if you go through the bush?

451
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
- Oh, come on, John.

452
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I know you take a bullet for me,

453
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
but you can't hold my hand in every situation.

454
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I'm a man of the people.

455
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
(audience laughing)

456
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
(audience laughing)

457
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
- Hey.

458
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
(audience laughing)

459
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
(audience laughing)

460
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
(gunshot)

461
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
(audience laughing)

462
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
(gunshot)

463
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
(audience laughing)

464
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
- Can I use your toilet?

465
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
(audience laughing)

466
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Put the next door down as undecided as well.

467
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
- She seemed pretty decided.

468
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
- I think the problem, Arthur,

469
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
is that you're coming across less as a politician

470
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and more as a strange crawling toilet hedgeman.

471
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
- Yeah, of course.

472
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So you're not really listening to people.

473
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I was shot up, will ya?

474
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Someone's coming.

475
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
- Right, I'm leaving.

476
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
(audience laughing)

477
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
- What's up, correct, to these signs?

478
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
(audience laughing)

479
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
- Well, good afternoon.

480
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Would you like to vote for me

481
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
because if you would,

482
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I would be prepared to listen to you.

483
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
- Well, I'm standing on a bipartisan platform.

484
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
(audience laughing)

485
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And if elected, I would work very hard for you

486
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and your fellow, um,

487
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
throw the tear out.

488
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
- What would you do then?

489
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
- I'm glad you asked me then.

490
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
First thing at the very top of my agenda

491
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
on day one would be to allow betting in cafes.

492
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
- Huh.

493
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I like the sound of that.

494
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
- I like the be-off that--

495
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
- What did you say?

496
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
You're interested.

497
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
- I'm very interested.

498
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I've never been able to understand why that's illegal.

499
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
- Wonderful.

500
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
But perhaps you'd like to sign here

501
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and become a member of our mailing group.

502
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
- And we're going to ban eggs.

503
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
- Well, if you're shaky, stop saying that.

504
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
- You're gonna ban eggs.

505
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
- What my minister for--

506
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
(audience laughing)

507
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
- What are you minister of?

508
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
- Health, sir.

509
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
What my minister for health means is that eggs

510
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
will be placed under review.

511
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
We plan to have a referendum.

512
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
- Why?

513
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
- Uh...

514
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
- Hitler, eight eggs.

515
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
- Shush-ecky.

516
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
So, can we count on your support?

517
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
- I was getting rid of eggs.

518
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
- A lie, cakes.

519
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
- Ha-ha!

520
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Who doesn't like eggs?

521
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
- I don't.

522
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
- They're delicious.

523
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
- Are you a real minister, just say--

524
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
- Not my health, minister.

525
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
- What?

526
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
- Yes, I am.

527
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
- No, you're not.

528
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
I've changed it.

529
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
You can be minister for law of an island.

530
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
- Sorry, I need to think about this.

531
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I'd like to put bets on in cafes,

532
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
but not if there's no eggs.

533
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Good luck to you.

534
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
- Eggy, stop talking about Hitler.

535
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
At least until we're re-elected.

536
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
(audience laughing)

537
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
- What?

538
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
- Oh, no, no.

539
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
- Uh...

540
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
- Hello?

541
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
- Listen.

542
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Listen to this.

543
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Come over, Michael.

544
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I know you're why this fight is so important.

545
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
- No, it's all very important.

546
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
- Michael, get yourself over here right now.

547
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
We need to talk about strategy.

548
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000
- Come on, you get, Chris.

549
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
(audience laughing)

550
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
As soon as I'm in power, I'll be coming for you.

551
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Whoever you are.

552
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
- Please, please, please shut up.

553
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
- Yeah, that's the voice of the people

554
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
who are telling you to shut up.

555
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
- Oh, that's the...

556
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Arthur, hello, Michael.

557
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Who are you shouting at?

558
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
The nightmare is of it.

559
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
What is?

560
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
The road works.

561
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000
There aren't any road works.

562
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
- What?

563
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
- There aren't any road works.

564
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
- What's everyone complaining about them?

565
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
- You.

566
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
They're complaining about you, shouting.

567
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
I think you might have tinnitus Arthur.

568
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Dad had it.

569
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
It gets worse when it's quiet, hence the road works.

570
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
- So you're saying my whole campaign is based on

571
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
imaginary road works.

572
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Maybe it was the boxing, didn't you say you used to box?

573
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
- I did.

574
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
That was my best fight.

575
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I lasted four seconds.

576
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
(audience laughing)

577
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I trained myself to get the first punch in

578
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
as soon as the fight started.

579
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
- So Mr. Rida, was as good as Dad?

580
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
No, it's happening again.

581
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Yeah, I'm just one of life's loses, Michael.

582
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
- Arthur, come on.

583
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
- Don't be like that.

584
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
- Maybe you didn't have the stamina to be a boxer

585
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
and maybe you're too impatient and annoying

586
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
to be a good politician.

587
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
But...

588
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
- Ew.

589
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
- No, I don't think there's a positive way to win that sentence.

590
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
(audience laughing)

591
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
- Look, for the minute, what...

592
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Why don't we just imagine that I've made a rousing

593
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
and reassuring speech that makes you feel like

594
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
everything's gonna be okay?

595
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
- I won't imagine that.

596
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
(audience laughing)

597
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
(audience laughing)

598
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
(audience laughing)

599
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
- Thank you, Michael.

600
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
The words I imagined you were saying have touched me deeply.

601
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
- Please, it really was the least I could do.

602
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
- You've always believed in me, Michael.

603
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
- No, I haven't.

604
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
(audience laughing)

605
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
But as long as you never have any real power

606
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
or any degree of responsibility over people's lives,

607
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I am proud to be on your team.

608
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
(audience laughing)

609
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
(audience laughing)

610
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
- What are you doing?

611
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
- Again, Kevin, with the idea of poems and warm stuff

612
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
and being used to watch out the citizens.

613
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
(audience laughing)

614
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
- I don't think that's a good idea, Ragi.

615
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
- Is he not?

616
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Too late now, anyway.

617
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
(audience laughing)

618
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
- It was what he's doing, Michael.

619
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
It's the minutes of the help.

620
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
- You're the an island.

621
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
(audience laughing)

622
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
- And he was head of security,

623
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
and so that constitutes an assault.

624
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
- Hey!

625
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
- What?

626
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
- What is this?

627
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
(audience laughing)

628
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
- It's not very...

629
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
- A tiny bell, you said.

630
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
- Why didn't I talk?

631
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
- What happened to the hell?

632
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
It was a terrible idea.

633
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Don't know what thing you advice from customers

634
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
about my business.

635
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
- No more ideas from you.

636
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Terrible idea, man.

637
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
(audience laughing)

638
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
- Can maybe a bigger bell?

639
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
(audience laughing)

640
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
- That's brilliant.

641
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
(audience laughing)

642
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
- Is that better?

643
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
(audience laughing)

644
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Are you talking?

645
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
(audience laughing)

646
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
- Again, he's completely deaf.

647
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
(audience laughing)

648
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
- You can't hear the bloody thing.

649
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
(audience laughing)

650
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
He can't run a campaign like this.

651
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
But just wiggy Arthur, you'll be fine.

652
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Agree with everyone.

653
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
(audience laughing)

654
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
- Are you talking now?

655
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
(audience laughing)

656
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
(audience laughing)

657
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
- And they put all the rubbish out on the street.

658
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Don't even sort it out properly,

659
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
and it's not even on the right days.

660
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
(audience laughing)

661
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
- And you've finished now.

662
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
I could tell you quite sincerely, when listening.

663
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
(audience laughing)

664
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
- Thank you.

665
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
To be honest, I couldn't understand

666
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
what he was saying to me the last time,

667
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
but it's like speaking to a completely different person.

668
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
(audience laughing)

669
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I think he really understands our concerns.

670
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
(audience laughing)

671
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
- That's the 11th house that's given it yet.

672
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
- Ever since you started green with everybody,

673
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
he's gone crazy.

674
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
- He's only agreeing with everybody,

675
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
'cause he can't hear the voice.

676
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
'Cause he can't hear them.

677
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
You can't be that simple, can he?

678
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
You can't just get into power,

679
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
because you've lost your hearing, can you?

680
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
(audience laughing)

681
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
(audience laughing)

682
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
So, what's happening?

683
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
(audience laughing)

684
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
No, we need it now, go and get it.

685
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
- Should I be worrying about this strong chap?

686
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
No.

687
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
- You know he's the fellow from the cafe.

688
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
- What? The pound shop Paxman was.

689
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
- Press, I still have your field day with it.

690
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
- Maybe we should have a rematch.

691
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
(audience laughing)

692
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
- That's not a bad idea.

693
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
- It's for you.

694
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
- Hello?

695
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
- Mr. Strong.

696
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
- I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Cooling.

697
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
- I thought you and him

698
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
might like to have another little chin wag.

699
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
- A little one there.

700
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
(audience laughing)

701
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
- Hang up on me.

702
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
- I can scared.

703
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Make sure the camera's there.

704
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I'll wipe the floor with him.

705
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
- All right, dude.

706
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
- Who are all these people?

707
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
- Well, in tears,

708
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
they just started turning up.

709
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Our message is really hitting home.

710
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
- What message?

711
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
There is no message.

712
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
- We're listening, isn't that the message?

713
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
- He's deaf.

714
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
(audience laughing)

715
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
- What is this?

716
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
- What is this?

717
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
- Can you get off me?

718
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
This is all my fault.

719
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
I should never have made him imagine that speech.

720
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I've created a monster.

721
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
- Like Frankenstein.

722
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
- This is like Frankenstein.

723
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
- No, you're like Frankenstein.

724
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
- Oh, yes, sorry, yes, yes, yes.

725
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
- Michael, hi.

726
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
- I thought this has gone far enough.

727
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
- I certainly do.

728
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
(audience laughing)

729
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I think you should withdraw from the election.

730
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
- That means a lot.

731
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
You've always believed in me, Michael.

732
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
- I have never believed in me.

733
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
- I do, hope so.

734
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
(audience laughing)

735
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Okay, okay, guys, settle down.

736
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
In fact, you were saying anything.

737
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
(audience laughing)

738
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Few more weekends been.

739
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Thanks to you guys, I've closer than I've ever been

740
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
to getting a free hat and glasses.

741
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
(audience cheering)

742
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
But there's still work to be done.

743
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Remember, we need to concentrate on the issues.

744
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
- What is you?

745
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
What is you?

746
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
- Yes, no issue.

747
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
- Take it to the gentlemen by director of communications.

748
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
(audience cheering)

749
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
- Arthur should not be running.

750
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
He is completely deaf, and he doesn't know what's happening.

751
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
(audience laughing)

752
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
If he is elected, it will be a disaster for this community.

753
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
- Listen to this guy, he knows what he's talking about.

754
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
(audience laughing)

755
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Please, please, he must be stopped before this goes any further.

756
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
(audience cheering)

757
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Why is there a one of these things to me?

758
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
I'm so excited for all of us!

759
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
(audience laughing)

760
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
(audience laughing)

761
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
- Ah ha, see, Nem!

762
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Look at this bad boy.

763
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I'm happy from this, it's all over.

764
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
(audience laughing)

765
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
- What are you doing now?

766
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Put it in some lemon juice to neutralise the washing up liquid.

767
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
- Does that matter work?

768
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
- I think so.

769
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Too late now, anyway.

770
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
(audience laughing)

771
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
- That was the hearing now, Arthur.

772
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Give it a minute, I gave only just a part of this stuff.

773
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
- Oh, I love that!

774
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
(audience laughing)

775
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
- The hearing's coming back.

776
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
(audience cheering)

777
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
- Give me my chances.

778
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
- It's the strong we meet again.

779
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I hear you've been troubling me in the polls.

780
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
- Would it be us out?

781
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
- No!

782
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
- May the best man win.

783
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
- Oh, go on, bud.

784
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
(snapping)

785
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
- So, you're not helping anymore.

786
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
- No, no, don't like the way things are going.

787
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
- The sign quality has gone down again.

788
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
- Oh, Eggie, are you all right?

789
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
No, no, they're on the road.

790
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I will have nothing to do with dangerous novelty politics.

791
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
- Finally, the one-off payment for those desperate

792
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
for new pouty-ers.

793
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
- That's amazing.

794
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
- Oh, hey, this will be a bit of fun.

795
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
- How about he takes a shot of the two of us

796
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
squaring up to each other?

797
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
- Yeah? Come on, Mrs. Poem, put 'em up.

798
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
(buzzer)

799
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
(bell ringing)

800
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
(audience laughing)

801
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
- Okay, let's go.

802
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
- We are here, Poem, please.

803
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
- Have some demarcus!

804
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
- Hey, well, we're acting for my bro.

805
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
(audience laughing)

806
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
- Mr. Strong was disqualified from the race

807
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
when he violent the attack as rival cantus, JP Kooling.

808
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I run it in his disqualification,

809
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
means bad news for the Kooling campaign

810
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
with his polling showing him today a win, Jooling.

811
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
(audience laughing)

812
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
- You do realize you lost, are you?

813
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

814
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
(audience laughing)

815
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
I knocked someone out, and it was on the telly.

816
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
- By now, we've all seen the video a thousand times,

817
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
but does it speak to an even more worrying trend?

818
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
The rise of stupidity.

819
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
(audience laughing)

820
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I understand that is actually Mr. Strong's head of communications.

821
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
(audience laughing)

822
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
- I'm gonna say that was wrong.

823
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
(audience laughing)

824
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
(upbeat music)

825
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
- Film 2015 follows next here on BBC One,

826
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
or for the story of the wildest pop music of all time,

827
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
head to BBC Four for the Kings of Rock and Roll.

828
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
(upbeat music)

829
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.580
(upbeat music)
